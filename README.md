# **STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT**

This package is but at the beginning of its creation. Will be publishing a version 1.0.0 once library is more useful/functional

# React Fuego Mission

Is a simple React component library that heavily relies on styled components. Components are themable similar to some other libraries and is meant to be compatible with React, Next.js and React Native Applications. Components are meant to be flexible and can easily be composed to create exactly what you are looking for. I created this as both a fun challenge/ helpful library to help bootstrap React applications. I also just really didnt want the opinionated styling of MUI and did not want a cumbersome library such as react bootstrap. I wanted to create some lean and not to opinionated that could be easily customizable.
